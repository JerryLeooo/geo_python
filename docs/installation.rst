Installation
============

Now to use geo_python, you have to install the development version of redis-py first, and I am trysng to fix this...

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py/archive/master.zip#egg=redis

Stable release
--------------

To install GEO Python, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install geo_python

This is the preferred method to install GEO Python, as it will always install the most recent stable release. 

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.

.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io
.. _Python installation guide: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/


From sources
------------

The sources for GEO Python can be downloaded from the `Github repo`_.

You can either clone the public repository:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git://github.com/jerryleooo/geo_python

Or download the `tarball`_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl  -OL https://github.com/jerryleooo/geo_python/tarball/master

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python setup.py install
